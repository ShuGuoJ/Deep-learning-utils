# The utils of deep learning
## Description
The repository is used to store the basic code about deep learning and data preprocess during my undergraduate to reduce the developing time.
## Installation
1.pytorch  
2.numpy

## Instruction
1.`Trainer.py` contains a class named as `Trainer`, which can be used to train and evaluate deep learning model. It can adopt in any deep learning model by slightly modifying the code of the output of dataset, the input of model and the calculation of loss function.
